I'm a experimental nuclear physicist turned data scientist.  I have a history of using computer simulations for product and experimental optimizations.  I'm currently working at General Assembly in New York City, teaching their full-time Data Science Immersive focusing on machine learning in Python, statistics, and SQL.
