On Monday night I attended a Meetup at the Ebay headquarters hosted by Data Visualization New York (and Naomi Robbins, particularly).

The event was well attended with over 100 people showing and comfortably fitting in the eBay NYC headquarters.  The evening ran smoothly with some time to mingle and snack before settling down for to listen.  Naomi started things off with some great information on upcoming events she is working to organize.  Donations are graciously accepted, as are any offers for a venue that can comfortably seat over 150 attendees.  There are also speaking opportunities coming up in several lecture series, including one by O'Reilly.  After these breif notices, Naomi gave the floor to Nigel.

Nigel gave an amazing presentation that was only slightly diminished by technical difficulties with the audio equipment.  His main points were that data needs to tell its own story, and our job is to bring that message out undistorted and uncluttered.  "Less is clearer" was one of the main mottos.  That being said, there is often room to improvise a bit for entertainment value. Nigel showed us several examples of how the extras can help bring out the message in the data by attracting interest in an otherwise boring chart, or by demonstrating some aspects of the data to help the reader visualize the sense of scale.  There were also some examples of the extras distracting from the message of the data, and even distorting it in some cases.

All in all, it was a great talk with a little whimsy and a lot of great examples.  Nigel was a terrific speaker and honed in on how to demonstrate data in as many ways as possible (tables, charts, annotated photos, physical props!) while not overwleming the viewer or distorting the story.  I had a great time, met some wonderful people, and look forward to attending the next presentation from Data Visualization New York.
